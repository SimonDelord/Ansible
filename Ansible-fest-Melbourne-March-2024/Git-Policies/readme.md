This repo contains the policies used to configure the K8 clusters / resources accordingly.
For example we find policies to install:
 - ACS (Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes)
 - AMQ Streams e.g Kafka
 - AAP and EDA (Ansible Automation Platform / Event Driven Ansible)

The actual configuration of each of those Operators can be done using GitOps as well or by using a tool like AAP.
